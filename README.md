Live Share Counter is a sample Visual Studio Code extension, that adds a collaborative counter to the Live Share `Session Details` view. It's meant to illustrate how to use the [Live Share SDK](https://npmjs.com/vsls), in order to synchronize custom state between participants in a collaboration session.
